# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Illegal Logic"
  description:  "This circuit logic emits a sequences of 32 hexadecimal digits to the 7 segment display which may be considered illegal in certain jurisdictions. The sequence is considered to be an illegal number."
  how_it_works: "There is some combinatorial logic which generates 32 numbers and then decodes those digits to the 7 segment display."
  how_to_test:  "First, raise the reset I/O (io_in[1]) high.  Then Output Enable (io_in[2]) high for 32 cycles."
  external_hw:  "The 7-segment display is used directly."
  language:     "verilog"
