# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "π"
  description:  "This circuit outputs the first 256 decimal digits of Pi (π)"
  how_it_works: "There is some combinatorial logic which generates 256 numbers and then decodes those digits to the 7 segment display."
  how_to_test:  "There is no clock, only logic"
  external_hw:  "The 7-segment display is used directly."
  language:     "verilog"

  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.
