# Tiny Tapeout Pi (Ï€)

This circuit logic emits the first 256 decimal digits of Pi to the 7 segment
display.  A previous circuit in this repository only used 4% of the die area,
which seemed like a waste of space.

## How to use

Pass the index value in (0-255).  The digit corresponding to that index is
emitted directly to the 7 segment display.

## What is Tiny Tapeout?

TinyTapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper
than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip!
